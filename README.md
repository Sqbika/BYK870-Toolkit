# BYK870-Toolkit
Toolkit for the BYK870 MCU. Firmware de-, re-compiler, instruction set, etc...

## What?
It's *going* to be a Toolkit for the BYK870 MCU, which uses the 8051 instruction set. How long is it going to take for me to start this project? Well, I literally started learning ASM since I got this keyboard, so a year? There are already [sources](https://gist.github.com/castleberrysam/a0bb370382339acfaac461a2359d0f94) and [decompilers](https://gist.github.com/castleberrysam/2510f3e87b3d313a27320f165ef5e1cc) for the BYK870 firmware, so the foundations are already there, just now need to build up something...
